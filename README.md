#Customer segmentation using RFM analysis


We aim to segment the customers based on their Location(city), frequency of purchases and monetary values of their purchases. The customers are then ranked based on these attributes. Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately. Segmentation allows marketers to better tailor their marketing efforts to various audience subsets. Those efforts can relate to both communications and product development. Specifically, segmentation helps a company: 
• Create and communicate targeted marketing messages that will resonate with specific groups of customers. 
• Identify ways to improve products or new product or service opportunities. 
• Establish better customer relationships. 
• Test pricing options. 
• Focus on the most profitable customers.
